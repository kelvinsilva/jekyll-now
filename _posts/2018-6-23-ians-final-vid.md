We have finally submitted our project and had it approved by our professor (Anujan Varma). We finalized the project in the beginning of June.

To recap, our project consists of a small robotic car which can create maps of indoor environments, and autonomously navigate (Through a Web User Interface) within said environment. The robotic car contains sensors such as 360 deg laser scanner (RPLidar) and motors with encoders for odometry. On the software side, we use a multitude of available open source software from the ROS (Robot Operating System) platform, as well as custom written software.
