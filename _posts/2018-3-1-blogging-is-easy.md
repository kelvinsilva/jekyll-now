title: Blogging is easy!

Previously this page was hand crafted HTML File which I created for my front facing online profile. It was reminiscent of the early era of the internet where anyone could create their own page and everything was handwritten by html. I wanted to give a feeling of throwback to the early era, but in reality it was an extremely ugly page. You can find it in my github repository kelvinsilvaAlternative github static repo. 

I was looking how I could create something more modern looking with as little effort as possible. Turns out that there is the Jekyll static site generator for github pages, and it seemed promising. All you have to do is write markdown and it turns each markdown page into a properly formatted website. However I was still looking for something of less effort, as with Jekyll, it looked like I had to setup a small environment and run a few commands which I was not interested in putting the time towards.

I found an abstraction on top of Jekyll called Jekyll-Now. All I had to do was fork that repo and change some config files to generate the proper website that I wanted. It was easy, simple, and I didn't need to download or type a single command.

This is basically my Hello World first blog post, and Im happy to say that it has been a great experience so far.

In the future, I would like to talk about my experience with Robot Operating System and ROS, as well as my progress in my enrollment of a Udacity course on AI Programming for Robotics.
