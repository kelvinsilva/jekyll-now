title: ACM Hackathon Experience
---

I was invited to participate in the ACM Hackathon hosted at UC Santa Cruz with my good friend Daniel.

This hackathon lasts 12 hours instead of the usual 24, which means that I was extremely interested, as I do not want to waste a complete day stuck in a room.
Usually I don't like hackathons because nothing productive gets done after a good 8 hour work shift, and usually you end up miserable. Not a feeling that I like.

Im the type of dude that likes to wake up early, with a good cup of coffee and breakfast in the stomach before heading to do work.
The morning is the best time to work, as the mind is fresh and ready from a good nights of sleep.

The project that we embarked upon was to create an Amazon Alexa App which would take in queries for the nearest UCSC Loop bus. 
We were worried that the current implementation on slugroute.com did not have an API or a way of retrieving GPS data from Loop buses.

I snooped around in my view-page-source curiousness and eventually found that they indeed had an API endpoint.

http://bts.ucsc.edu:8081/location/get

Weirdly named. However, it gives the position of each Loop bus Lat/Long coordinates.

I also was able to grab the position of existing Loop bus stops from their javascript source. This way, the alexa app would just need to compare the closest loop to the closes stop of Alexa's location.

The biggest challenge was deciding which direction the bus was running. <More to come>
