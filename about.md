### Introduction

A computer systems engineer interested in robotics and computer systems. I have been playing with computers since I was a small child. In 2011 I started my career by reading Stephen Prata's C++ Primer Plus 5th edition, and starting my college years in Computer Science and Engineering in 2013. 

Aside from that, I love to go to the gym, as well as learning MMA and Kickboxing.

Other minor interests include urban planning and city scapes, as well as geography.

Over the years I have developed an interest in Robotics Programming and Robotics due to the tangible and physical results that it gives. Watching a lifeless object become animated through lines of computer code provides a satisfaction of accomplishment that other kinds of areas in Computer Engineering do not provide.

### Current Activity

Currently a Full Time Software Engineer for Collins Aerospace (formerly Rockwell Collins). Located in Cedar Rapids, IA.

I work on the legacy Airborne GPS Receivers from Collins Aerospace. The product line dates back to the 1990's and it's been an interesting experience. I work with a lot of legacy code that was translated from Jovial to C. My current work deals with implementing new features within this legacy codebase, and understanding legacy designs to fix newly discovered bugs. 

The GPS Embedded Module VII-2 is one of the main products which I am actively writing software for. The GEMVII-2 project is a project meant to take the latest product in the GEM product line (GEM VII) and update it to be backwards compatible with the original GEM II receiver that was built in the early 90's. The company doesn't produce this old receiver anymore, so to rejuvenate the product line, we took a more modern version of the GEM and wrote software to comply with ICD-GPS-059 (1990's GPS Interface Protocol), and added some new features that were required by our customer that the original receiver did not have.
