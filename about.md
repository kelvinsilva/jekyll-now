### Information

Age: 21

Location: Santa Cruz, CA

Legal Status: U.S. Citizen

Looking for FULL TIME position starting in June. Willing to relocate anywhere.

### Introduction

A computer systems engineer interested in robotics and computer systems. I have been playing with computers since I was a small child. In 2011 I started my career by reading Stephen Prata's C++ Primer Plus 5th edition, and starting my college years in Computer Science and Engineering in 2013. 

Aside from that, I love to go to the gym, as well as learning MMA and Kickboxing.

Other minor interests include urban planning and city scapes, as well as geography.

Over the years I have developed an interest in Robotics Programming and Robotics due to the tangible and physical results that it gives. Watching a lifeless object become animated through lines of computer code provides a satisfaction of accomplishment that other kinds of areas in Computer Engineering do not provide.

### Current Activity

I am currently the lead software developer for an Indoor Autonomous Navigation System project. The task at hand is to create a small robotic car which can autonomously navigate the indoor environment of the Jack Baskin Engineering building here at UC Santa Cruz.
